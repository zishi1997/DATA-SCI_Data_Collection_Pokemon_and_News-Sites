It\\'s something that he says has been extra important during such tough times.\\n\\n\"When you\\'re able to provide that kind of care and consideration that you would to a family member or a friend or someone that you just care about, why is it any different for a relationship between the sports team and its fans? It should be the same,\" Arhancet tells CNN Sport.\\n\\n\"I think a lot of other teams take it for granted. They just assume that you could just watch our content and that\\'s enough. It isn\\'t. You have to care and you have to listen and you have to remember.\"\\n\\nJUST WATCHED How I quarantined for two weeks to play video games for 100M people Replay More Videos ...

On the online platform, fans can win points for engaging with the team\\'s social media which can in turn earn them special experiences with their favorite team and players.\\n\\nIt also provides a space for fans to talk to one another and play specialized games.\\n\\n\"It\\'s very exciting to get some kind of reward for what you do there with them, simply because it\\'s some kind of reward for things that you\\'re already doing,\" says Romann.\\n\\nThe new platform encourages fans to connect their social media accounts allowing Team Liquid a chance to learn more about its fan base and tailor content accordingly.\\n\\nIn many ways, Liquid+ is the first of its kind and Arhancet says it won\\'t be long before other teams follow suit.\\n\\n\"I think it\\'s good that other esports teams are thinking about it in this way, and I think it will overall help the esports ecosystem,\" he says.\\n\\n\"I\\'m kind of glad to see that kind of innovation happen by other teams. It will level up what we\\'re doing.\"\\n\\nBeing able to provide this \"virtual stadium\" will also help esports stay ahead of the curve in terms of more traditional sports, says Arhancet.\\n\\n\"We don\\'t have big stadiums, but what we do have is this kind of digital stadium where we can provide the same sort of experiences and events and even food and beverage,\" he says.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not limited to just the folks that are coming to that 10,000 person stadium. We can do a global event and publish around the world to all of our fans, which is a bigger opportunity to reach more people.\"',\n",

              "  'full article': '(CNN) For someone who describes herself as a \"pretty quiet person,\" Cat Phillips has shown herself to be utterly unafraid of speaking out.\\n\\nA rarity in the sporting world, Phillips is a multi-sport athlete, who competes in both ultimate frisbee and Australian football.\\n\\nWhile the Australian Football League men\\'s competition was founded in 1896, the women\\'s inaugural season didn\\'t kick off until 2017.\\n\\nFor some AFL fans the idea of women showcasing their handling and kicking skills with the oval-shape ball has come as a bit of a culture shock, according to Phillips.\\n\\n\"A lot of the comments that you get in Australia around the AFLW [Australian Football League Women\\'s], are that the quality of the league isn\\'t good enough and women shouldn\\'t be being paid because they\\'re just not good enough,\" Phillips told CNN Sport, as she reflected on what it\\'s been like playing in the fledgling league.\\n\\nNo wonder, perhaps, that Phillips feels so strongly about gender equality.\\n\\n\"That, to me, is just the lack of education,\" adds the 29-year-old, who points out that perhaps if these men hadn\\'t grown up playing Aussie football and were working full-time and training in the evening, the same way the women are, the quality of the league would be different.\\n\\nIn 2020, the average AFL men\\'s player earned $215,890 USD while the highest-earning player in the league earned $924,289. In contrast, the highest paid women\\'s players earned only $23,002.\\n\\nPhillips is also the co-founder of the Australian Ultimate League -- the only mixed-gender, semi-professional field sport in the world.\\n\\nAnd somehow, the two-sport star also finds the time to work as an engineer.\\n\\nUltimate frisbee is a self-officiated sport that is played mixed-gender at the highest level -- the World Games.\\n\\nHowever, many semi-professional leagues have opted for single-gender competition, making what Phillips has done in Australia special.\\n\\nPhillips says her experience in ultimate frisbee has been more positive than it has been in the AFLW when it comes to issues of equality.\\n\\nCat Phillips of the Saints runs with the ball during the round 1 AFLW match between the St Kilda Saints and the Western Bulldogs at RSEA Park on January 29, 2021 in Melbourne, Australia.\\n\\nRole model\\n\\nBorn in London, Phillips grew up in Melbourne, where she discovered her love of ultimate frisbee in high school before she was selected for the ALFW\\'s inaugural season during a talent search.\\n\\n\"I think I took it for granted that a lot of parts of ultimate are very equal, relatively speaking, and that was something that I really loved about it at the beginning. But I probably didn\\'t recognize the importance of it until I moved into football.\"\\n\\nHowever, she appreciates the platform the ALFW has given her.\\n\\n\"Coming into the AFLW, I saw the impact that we had on young girls but also on young boys -- people who all of a sudden were looking at the league and had female role models that they could look up to -- and that has really impacted me,\" said Phillips.\\n\\nAs captain of the Australian women\\'s ultimate frisbee team and the captain of St. Kilda FC in the AFLW, Phillips is determined to use her leadership positions to help create change.\\n\\n\"For me, it\\'s not even about the players that are playing in the league. Obviously, I want equality for them, but it\\'s more about the broader impact of it.\\n\\n\"Kids who, at eight or nine ... [who see] it\\'s normal that you would have women playing at that level. And I think that\\'s really powerful and I feel very strongly that we need to keep moving forward in that area.\"\\n\\nCat Phillips is a multi-sport athlete who is fighting for change in both the AFLW and in ultimate frisbee.\\n\\nMixed-gender league\\n\\nAs ultimate frisbee has grown over the last decade, semi-professional leagues have begun to pop up around the globe.\\n\\nThe American Ultimate Disc League (AUDL) was founded in 2010 and played its inaugural season in 2012.\\n\\nBut the league was created for men\\'s teams only, although it did allow women to try-out for teams.\\n\\nDespite discussions and a push from the ultimate community to add women\\'s teams to the league, the AUDL has remained a men\\'s league.\\n\\nIn 2018, when Phillips started the Australian Ultimate League (AUL), she opted for a different approach, creating the world\\'s first mixed- gender league in the world to provide an equal opportunity for men and women to compete.\\n\\nIn the years that have followed the AUL\\'s creation, women\\'s leagues such as the Premier Ultimate League (PUL) have been set up in the US.\\n\\nWhat Phillips has done by creating a mixed-gender league is not only in line with the sport\\'s highest level -- it\\'s played as a mixed sport at the World Games -- but also with the International Olympic Committee\\'s vision to create a more gender-equitable Games by including more mixed events.\\n\\nAnd, as ultimate strives for inclusion in the Olympic Games, Phillips believes it is important for the sport to show that it\\'s unique -- and that women can compete with men on the same field.\\n\\nCat Phillips in action for the Melbourne Demons against the Fremantle Dockers at Casey Fields on March 18, 2017 in Melbourne, Australia.\\n\\nLeadership skills\\n\\nDespite the fact she holds the position of captain on two sports teams, Phillips says the idea of leadership didn\\'t come easily.\\n\\n\"I like to keep to myself a little bit, but again the more involved I\\'ve got in footy and in ultimate, and in thinking about gender equity in particular, it\\'s definitely become more important to me,\" she explains.\\n\\n\"I look at a lot of the young players that are coming through both in footy and in ultimate, and I just see so much potential in them.\\n\\n\"They\\'re all such incredible young women and I feel a lot of ownership and responsibility around helping them to grow and helping them to develop into really strong, powerful women.\"\\n\\nThese days it isn\\'t easy being a female leader.\\n\\nIn early 2020, the online abuse of AFLW players became so bad that some organizations had to shut down their comments sections.\\n\\nNotably a photo of Carlton Blues player Tayla Harris, which captured her athleticism, gained significant negative attention and Australian broadcaster Channel 7 removed the post after only 24 hours as the comments had become too difficult to monitor.\\n\\nPhillips says social media doesn\\'t play a big part in her life, which has ensured she hasn\\'t been as affected as other athletes who have suffered abuse.\\n\\n\"Obviously, I know that it\\'s there and I think you only have to read the comments on one article posted online to get a broad view of the things that people think.\"\\n\\nShe also believes there\\'s a groundswell of support for the AFLW and says that it\\'s just a matter of time before the league is given the recognition and respect it deserves.\\n\\n\"One, the quality will keep going up,\" reflects Phillips. \"And two, I think the more people get exposed to it and start to understand a bit more about the differences between what the men and the women are doing, the feel about it in the community will change.\\n\\n\"There are a whole lot of people that are very supportive and very much on board with the league.\\n\\n\"And I tend to engage with those people, because they love what we\\'re doing, and I think it\\'s much more positive to keep focused on that.\"\\n\\nPhillips of the Demons (R) and Rheanne Lugg of the Crows compete for the ball during the round two AFLW match between the Melbourne Demons and the Adelaide Crows at Casey Fields on February 10, 2018 in Melbourne, Australia.\\n\\nVision\\n\\nAccording to Phillips, the number of women playing Australian Football at grassroots level has increased significantly.\\n\\n\"Even if you just walked down to the local park five years ago, you would only have seen men or boys playing the footy and now you\\'ll see girls everywhere kicking the footy.\"\\n\\nPhillips has a 10-year vision that AFLW players will mostly be full-time and don\\'t have to balance careers while competing, though she admits that such a prospect is unlikely for ultimate frisbee.\\n\\n\"I think the cool thing here in Australia with ultimate is looking at the development of our youth pathways,\" said Phillips.\\n\\n\"Back when I started, there were a handful of people playing at my age. I think there were only about four in Victoria, where I come from.\\n\\n\"Now we have teams in every state in Australia and they have a youth national championship.\\n\\n\"That\\'s just bringing more people into the game younger and it\\'s the same with the AFL; the earlier you start playing, the better you\\'ll get.\"\\n\\nPhillips is currently competing in the AFLW season, with the goal of winning the Premiership trophy at the end of April, all while she continues to train for her other goal of competing in her third World Games for Australia in ultimate in 2022.',\n",

To him, the F1 great was just his dad.\\n\\nAs he grew older, however, he began to see the value in all the lessons his dad gave him. Today, Schumacher sees many of his father\\'s traits in his own driving style and doesn\\'t shy away from the comparisons.\\n\\n\"I guess we\\'re probably different in a few ways, but we\\'re very similar in other ways,\" he explains. \"It\\'s very interesting to see how we how we do things on track. For me, when I compare myself [to him], it is very much in his prime, the peak of his career when he was racing with Ferrari and having all those world championships.\\n\\n\"But it\\'s also very good for me to compare myself to him when he started in Formula One ... we just have to be able to compare in both phases I\\'d say -- compare myself to the beginning, but also compared to the end of his career.\\n\\nMick Schumacher doesn\\'t shy away from driving comparisons with his dad.\\n\\n\"You always have to measure yourself to the best today, but also to the best in the past and obviously my dad is the best and he\\'s always going to be the best. I feel privileged to be able to compare myself to him and see what steps he took over the years, but [also] what different choices he took and I learned from them.\"\\n\\nDespite his upbringing as the son of one of the greatest drivers of all time, it wasn\\'t always a given that Schumacher would reach motorsport\\'s elite level.\\n\\nIn 2019, he finished his first season in Formula Two in 12th place, 213 points behind the eventual champion despite driving for the best team in the championship.\\n\\nFollowing a frank discussion with his PREMA Racing team principle Rene Rosin, his fortunes transformed and in 2020 he was crowned F2 champion, winning the title by 14 points.\\n\\nFerrari, the team with which Michael Schumacher became synonymous, has been crucial in aiding Mick\\'s development as a driver. The German is part of the Italian team\\'s prestigious Ferrari Driver Academy, signing up in 2019, and joins a list of alumni that includes Charles Leclerc, Antonio Giovinazzi and the late Jules Bianchi.\\n\\nAlthough his position in the sport may have looked somewhat precarious from the outside, Schumacher\\'s drive and work ethic meant he was always likely to succeed.\\n\\n\"Obviously you always have to have a basis of talent on any anything you do and I feel like through karting and through racing, you just learn to adapt to things very quickly,\" he explains. \"So I\\'m generally very easily learning new things, especially when it\\'s something about sports.\\n\\n\"I guess in our sport, if you love what you do and you have a bit of talent and you are willing to work for your dream, that\\'s all it takes in a way to be able to then put a lot of time on track. If you are willing to to work every day, every minute on yourself and dedicate life, basically, to the sport, then most likely [you] will do well -- and that\\'s what I\\'m doing.\"\\n\\nMick Schumacher celebrates with the Prema Racing after winning the F2 championship.\\n\\nSuch was his love of driving growing up, Schumacher admits there was \"never a plan B.\" While the other kids at school dreamed of becoming astronauts or the president, his singular focus was on racing around a track.\\n\\nIn Bahrain later this month, his dream of becoming a Formula One driver like his father will be realized.\\n\\n\"I guess I will be a bit nervous, but nevertheless I think I\\'m very much prepared,\" he says. \"It\\'s going to be very fun. I think it\\'s going to be a hell of a ride.\"',\n",

And with several African films up for official nominations, people across the continent will be paying close attention when those nominations are announced on Monday.\\n\\nThe South African documentary film \"My Octopus Teacher\" is on the shortlist for an Academy Award this year.\\n\\nAs films from the continent continue to gain international recognition, Philippe Lacôte, Ivorian director of the 2020 film \"Night of the Kings\" (also on the shortlist for an International Feature Oscar nomination) says it is important for Africans to create movies that include their vision of the world.\\n\\nHis film explores themes across the physical world and the mythical one. Last year, he told CNN in an interview that it was key to show the world these themes because they are a part of Ivory Coast\\'s culture.\\n\\n\"Today, Ivory Coast is on the map of international cinema,\" he said. \"It\\'s important for me -- even if it\\'s one film. We don\\'t want to be outside this map.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, Nigeria\\'s film industry, Nollywood, will have to wait at least another year for its first chance at Oscar glory. The country, which has the largest film industry in Africa -- and the second largest in the world -- was disqualified in 2019 for failing to meet language requirements.\\n\\nAn evolving industry\\n\\nAfrican films are gaining more international attention as technology continues to remove some traditional access barriers -- helping films flourish across borders and find new audiences.\\n\\nVideo streaming sites like Disney+, iROKOtv , Netflix, YouTube, and Showmax act as aggregators, helping Africans gather and share content online from across the continent and beyond.\\n\\niROKOtv has hundreds of thousands of subscribers who can easily access Nigerian and Ghanaian movies from any part of the world. And Netflix, in partnership with multiple African filmmakers and production companies, is showcasing African movies that are accessible to people in over 190 countries.\\n\\nJason Njoku, co-founder of iROKOtv, says streaming services like his remove obstacles for Africans that traditionally blocked access to films from other regions. \"If you\\'re interested in Nigerian movies, you literally just have to go online and within a minute, you can have a complete, unlimited library for you to watch,\" he says, for \"anyone, anywhere in the world.\"\\n\\n\"Streaming platforms democratized content and storytelling,\" says Moses Babatope, co-founder of entertainment company FilmOne. \"What they have done is to break down any barriers like travel and immigration. They allow us to appreciate human stories across races and borders.\"\\n\\nChallenges and opportunities\\n\\nEven with streaming, Babatope says that cinemas still play an important role in getting movies across borders. His company has helped view and distribute several Nigerian titles, including the 2017 Nigerian romantic comedy \"The Wedding Party 2\", which was viewed in cinemas across the continent . It has become one of the highest-grossing Nollywood films in the last decade.\\n\\nThat outlet is important because while technology removes some barriers, it can add others; according to the World Bank, less than a third of Africa\\'s total population has access to broadband. Meanwhile, only 272 million people in sub-Saharan Africa have mobile internet access -- out of a population numbering more than 1 billion.\\n\\nThis means a significant part of the population is cut off from reaching video streaming sites such as Netflix and iROKOtv.\\n\\nBut Mary Njoku, director of the Nigerian production house ROK Studios, says it won\\'t always be this way.\\n\\n\"Most people in the upper-middle class can afford to stream, but it won\\'t be like that forever. Technological promise will catch up and then the market will explode,\" she says. \"So, we creatives just need to keep on creating amazing, compelling content and just wait.\"\\n\\nThe potential is massive, with the number of people in sub-Saharan Africa with mobile internet access projected to increase to 475 million by 2025 -- and as the industry continues to grow, international media conglomerates are looking to the continent for partnerships and original content.\\n\\nIn 2017, pay TV company StarTimes announced the listing of Nollywood movies as part of its offering for the Chinese market, signaling interest in Nigeria\\'s movie market.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Netflix has appointed award-winning Kenyan film producer Dorothy Ghettuba as its International Originals manager.

              "  'full article': '(CNN) \"Long Live Rock ... Celebrate the Chaos\" exalts the communal nature of hard rock, while mostly glossing over its excesses. The new documentary also misses a seemingly obvious coda that would have resonated after a year of shuttered live events -- namely, the impact of Covid-19 on those who embrace this music with a level of adulation that one artist likens to Comic-Con every night.\\n\\nDirector Jonathan McHugh talks to an assortment of performers, from groups like Metallica, Korn and Rage Against the Machine, as well as experts and fans for whom hard rock is their passion. The last bracket includes a billing manager in Ohio with young kids -- who refers to festivals as \"my therapy\" -- a couple that has turned crowd-surfing into a shared activity, and another enthusiast who discusses temporarily losing her prosthetic limb while sailing across a sea of hands.\\n\\nStill, the documentary gives away its lack of objectivity with the subtitle \"Celebrate the Chaos,\" reveling in the sense of escape derived from collisions within mosh pits, with nary a mention of the number of hospital visits such pastimes might generate.\\n\\nInstead, the academics focus on the tribal nature of the fan base and feelings of community, describing the bruising physical aspects of the associated rituals as a rite of passage. The bodies slamming together in mosh pits or the \"wall of death\" are really \"a camaraderie thing,\" says Korn lead singer Jonathan Davis, a way for attendees to \"get their aggressions out.\" And hey, as he notes, at least they\\'re not letting off steam by playing golf.\\n\\nThe one darker side explored involves drug use and overdose deaths by prominent artists -- a relatively brief detour, in which Dr. Drew Pinsky (who built a reality-TV franchise around celebrity addiction) discusses the relationship between rock and chemical dependency.\\n\\nRead More',\n",

              "  'full article': '(CNN) Turns out Soleil Moon Frye -- TV\\'s \"Punky Brewster\" -- meticulously documented her formative years, recently wading back through home movies, phone messages and photos and assembling them into \"Kid 90,\" a documentary that she calls \"A true chronological blueprint of what it was to grow up as a teenager in the \\'90s.\" But Frye was a special teen -- one with Zelig-like exposure to practically everyone else who was young and famous during those years.\\n\\nPremiering on Hulu, the 70-some-odd-minute film really plays like a companion to another recent documentary, Alex Winter\\'s HBO film \"Showbiz Kids,\" presenting a nostalgic but troubling vision of what it was like to be a child star. As proof, the film ends with sobering snapshots of all the friends that Frye, now 44, lost along the way.\\n\\nCast in her NBC sitcom at age seven, Frye cites her own questions as to whether \"things really happened the way I remembered them\" as motivation for the project, enlisting other former kid actors -- one wants to call them survivors -- to share their recollections. The list includes Stephen Dorff, Brian Austin Green, David Arquette, Balthazar Getty, Mark-Paul Gosselaar and more.\\n\\nMost remarkably, Frye toted a video camera around before cellphones were ubiquitous, which makes this behind-the-velvet-ropes access all the more intoxicating. While Frye talks about having a reasonably normal childhood all things considered, Gosselaar recalls being told that once an actor walked onto a TV or movie set, kid or no kid, \"You have to act like an adult.\"\\n\\nThere are plenty of memorable tidbits sprinkled throughout \"Kid 90,\" from Frye videotaping herself going for breast-reduction surgery as a teenager (after her rapid development made her the butt of cruel jokes) to video of her partying with pals -- drinking Jagermeister straight from the bottle -- quickly followed by footage of her delivering a pitch to \"Just Say No\" to drugs.\\n\\nRead More',\n",

              "  'full article': '(CNN) Tornadoes are among the most destructive forces in nature. They can level well-built structures, uproot trees, toss semitrucks -- and be deadly.\\n\\nThey are most common in the US Plains and Southeast, but have been reported in all 50 states. They can happen anytime during the day or night, so knowing the difference between a tornado watch and warning could mean the difference between life and death.\\n\\nThe Storm Prediction Center and local National Weather Service offices closely monitor developing thunderstorms and will issue a watch or warning if the storm warrants an alert.\\n\\nTornado watch\\n\\nA tornado watch is issued by the Storm Prediction Center. It means that conditions are favorable for a potential tornado. \"This highlights an area and usually alerts for the next four to six hours where risk is increasing,\" said Bill Bunting, chief of forecast operations at the prediction center.\\n\\nIf a tornado watch is issued, you should have your supplies, choose a safe place and have a plan in place -- just in case a tornado develops. This does not mean there is a tornado. This only means to be on watch and stay informed about the weather in your area in case things intensify.\\n\\nTornado warning\\n\\nA tornado warning means a tornado has been sighted, or that there is a strong indication on radar that a tornado is in progress. \"When a particular area (is) under an immediate risk, then the local office will issue a warning and that\\'s the call to action,\" said Bunting.\\n\\nIf a tornado warning is issued for your area, you should immediately seek shelter and get to your safe place until the tornado threat has passed. This means a tornado is imminent.\\n\\nSimply put:\\n\\nTornado watch -- Be on watch in case storms strengthen. Be alert.\\n\\nTornado warning -- Take action. Seek shelter immediately. A tornado has been spotted or indicated by weather radar.\\n\\nToday is Day 3 of Severe Weather Awareness Week! Today\\'s topic is Tornado Safety🌪️Here are some guidelines on sheltering during tornadoes & a review of Tornado Watch vs Tornado Warning. Stay tuned for more tips on how to take the best shelter in various places #txwx #ctxwx #dfwwx pic.twitter.com/ylDbSPtbTn — NWS Fort Worth (@NWSFortWorth) March 3, 2021\\n\\nSome have used light-hearted ways to help explain the difference.\\n\\nI\\'ve always enjoyed Brad Panovich\\'s (@wxbrad) analogy on a Tornado Watch vs. a Tornado Warning - pic.twitter.com/Y6y0VAccFT — Donald Harris (@heymistahdj) February 23, 2019\\n\\nWhat\\'s the difference btwn a wx watch (keep a weather eye to the sky) and a warning (take cover)? Know what to do. pic.twitter.com/zUB1VMUWGM — Henrico County Office of Emergency Management (@HenricoOEM) February 24, 2016\\n\\nWhile there\\'s nothing humorous about tornado alerts, if it helps remember the difference between a watch and a warning, then it\\'s worth it.\\n\\nTornadoes kill an average of 75 to 80 people in the US every year and without these warnings in place, that number could be much greater, according to Bunting.\\n\\nTornado emergency\\n\\nThere\\'s a third type of tornado alert that trumps them all. The tornado emergency was added in 1999 and it\\'s basically a tornado warning on steroids. If a tornado is in progress and will have a significant impact to human life, with catastrophic destruction to property, a tornado emergency will be issued.\\n\\nThis is the highest alert level given to a tornado event. \"It was an idea that came to the staff during a critical moment when a violent tornado moved into an area,\" said Bunting.\\n\\nHe\\'s talking about the Moore, Oklahoma, tornado in May 1999. It was a violent EF5 tornado that killed 36 people. It had the strongest winds ever recorded on the planet at 301 mph.\\n\\n\"It\\'s the strongest message we can send out of the office. it\\'s a way to amplify the message best we can,\" said Bunting.\\n\\nThe Storm Prediction Center urges people not to wait for a tornado emergency to be issued to take action. Take every storm seriously. They can change intensity quickly.\\n\\nThe center and the National Weather Service has spent countless hours trying to educate the public about the difference in these two terms, but many times there is still confusion when a tornado alert is issued.\\n\\nThat\\'s especially true for someone who has recently moved from an area that doesn\\'t experience many tornadoes. That\\'s why having a safety plan in place is key. \"Often times the minutes you save by getting into a safe place can make the difference in life and death,\" said Bunting.\\n\\nTornado safety\\n\\nFirst and foremost, you and your family should have a plan in place in case there is ever a tornado warning issued for your area. Have a small interior room or closet on the lowest level of your home designated as your tornado safe place.\\n\\nThere should be no windows in the room and it should be away from any outside walls. It\\'s a good idea to have a flashlight and a way to receive alerts while in the room. This could be in the form of a weather radio or your smartphone. Also make sure every family member has a helmet and shoes in the room.\\n\\n\"When a warning is issued is not the time to think about a safely plan. Put that in now so you know what to do when a warning is issued,\" said Bunting.',\n",
